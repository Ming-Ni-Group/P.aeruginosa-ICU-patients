The files contained in this folder are the blast results of recurrently mutated genes in this study to the NCBI nt database.The purpose is to find the gene or genome sequences in the database that with the same mutation 




The genomes and genes that with the same recurrently mutation can be found by the script (../../scripts/find-the-Mutations-from -blastn-results.py).


The file "list of recurrent genes and mutations recurrently.txt" lists all the recurrent mutated genes in this study.

The file "PAO1.sequence-genes.txt" lists all the genes of the reference PAO1 strain
